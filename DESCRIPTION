Description: Random Forest (RF) and Regularized Random Forest can be used for feature selection. Moreover, by Guided Regularized Random Forest, statistical-based weights are used to guide the regularization of random forest and further used for feature selection. This package can integrate prior information from multiple domains (statistical based and knowledge domain) to guide the regularization of random forest and feature selection.
